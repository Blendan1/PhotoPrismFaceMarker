# PhotoPrismFaceMarker

This is a Chrome extension, that allows you to manually mark faces in your images

## This project is currently in the working but still a needs a bit of work phase so be careful.

## installation:
Download the source code from develop unzip it and open chrome://extensions from there you enable developer mode and then press "load unpacked".

You then select the folder you unzipped where the metadata.json is.

Now just open photo prism (if you have it open reload) and when opening up an image and going to the people tap you should see a plus.



## how to use it


You just press the Plus and the image will open in full. There you can now start adding by pressing left click, resizing the market and confirming with another left click.

If you want to cancel drawing the marker press right click while drawing. When your not drawing a right click on the image will close it.

All changes will be saved instantly, no need to save separately.


I will improve the UI and the documentation in the coming days, if there are and issues or questions fell free to open an issue
